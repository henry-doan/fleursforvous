        WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND WHY WE COLLECT IT
      </h1>
      <p>
      When you fill out the inquiry form on this site, we collect the data from the inquiry form to process your order(s). We do not store any other information outside of the inquiry form you have submitted to us. We may ask you for any clarifications on the order(s) details. Your full name, email address, phone number, date needed by, time needed by, and occasion are all required fields to process your order(s) and to provide information on who is making the order(s). All of the other fields are optional.

      You will be contacted by us to confirm and discuss your order(s). This is to customize each of your orders based on your requests, questions, and concerns in a prompt manner.

      We may ask, with your permission, to use your social media handle to tag your finished order(s) on our site or social media platforms. We do not grab any other information from your social media platforms or use them for any other purpose.

        Analytics
      </h3>
      <p>
      We use the data from the inquiry form for our analytics to gather when the most orders are being placed as well as to see if there are any trends for us to plan ahead and purchase materials on time. We do not share this data with anyone else. We only use the date the orders have been placed. 
      </p>
      <h1>
        HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you have ordered from us, the data from the inquiry form that has been collected will be stored within our system until it is removed or if the order has been completed. If you want us to remove the information you have provided us, we will surely be happy to. 
      </p>
      <h1>
        WHAT ABOUT PAYMENT
      </h1>
      <p>
        We use Venmo, Apple Pay, and Cash App as third party tools for payment of orders. We accept cash in physical form as our other option; however, a half deposit or full payment is required to place your order(s). All payment and credit card information is carried out via Venmo, Apple Pay, and Cash App, or through cash. We do not store or keep track of your credit card information. For all of your questions and concerns within those apps, you would contact the applications themselves. We only receive your payment(s) and verify whether or not your order(s) has been paid.
