      <p>
        After watching countless Korean dramas, I became inspired to recreate something so beautiful, and that was making flower arrangements for others. I did not know anyone or anywhere that was able to do that for me living here in Utah. This sparked the idea of incorporating this certain bouquet look into as a small local business. I have always liked helping others, and with the support of my family and friends, this idea became a dream come true.
